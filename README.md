Hello Everyone.
I am Hisoka and this is my second project.
This is basically a bill machine. It has a price list where we have to add the items with their price initially to use them later on. When we have to go to the market to buy stuff we can input the name of the items in the checklist and it find the price of the items from the price list add to it.
